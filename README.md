# Auto-Addresses

Auto Address is a Auto Updating Address System and Partial Working Format, Which you can update your addresses with just a raw link hoster!

# What is this?

This (AA) can literally update some or maybe all of your addresses with just a link, you don't need to worry about manual updating addresses **ever again!**
This uses Json Scripts, C++ (mainly for dll), and other, and you don't need to worry about the addresses breaking/etc, they will stay auto-updated in our system!

# How to purchase?

**Robux** or **Money**, or any **source** is accepted. The robux amount is *100* every month, Money is *10$* every 6 months (so 20$ year). Read github bio and add me on discord.

# What addresses supported?

- luau_deserialize
- lua_spawn
- top, base
- identity
- lua_state
- set_identity
- lua_pushnil
- lua_pushboolean
- lua_getfield, setfield
(more yet to come soon!)

# About Raw Link?

This is where it will grab and fill out the addresses (DWORD, u_int, int), and replace them with the new ones. It'll take about *3-5* hours for it to update. You do not need the link, it will already be provided for you.

# Rules?

1: You can't be in Turkey, (pastebin banned), and we don't use other host links.
2: Must have at least one of the offsets in the **What addresses supported?** tab.
3: Must have PayPal, rbx account, discord account, no skid records (i will check).

# Requirements

- Visual Studio Installed
- Windows 10 (11 is gay)
- Discord Account/Tag
- Great Internet [otherwise injection will take a LOOONGGGG time]
- Lua library installed inside of project
- Must speak english (no espanol or etc)
